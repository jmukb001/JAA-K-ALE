Tambotchi Bot
Everyone has heard of the cultural phenomenon of the Tamagotchi, and now, Tambotchi Bot aims to bring the massively known virtual pet into a truly virtual pet. Tambotchi allows users to interact with a server-wide virtual pet, where they have the ability to care for it as a community.

How Does Tambotchi Work?
Tambotchi has three main ways to interact with the bot. The most notable is playing games with the bot, such as Slots, Higher or Lower, and Rock Paper Scissors. The next way you can interact with the bot is by feeding it (Make sure you make the right choice!). Finally, make sure you let your pet sleep once it's feeling a little tired. Keep this up, and you'll fulfill all your pet's desires!

What Options Do I Have?
Tambotchi Bot has two pets currently, Monty the Border Collie and Frankie the Axolotl. Make sure this is the first thing you do when using the bot! The following commands are available:

t!choose (Choose Your Pet)
t!RPS (Rock Paper Scissors)
t!slots (Play Slots)
t!HoL (Play Higher or Lower)
t!feed (Feed your pet)
t!nap (Give your Pet Some Rest!)
t!leaderboard (Display Leaderboard)
t!status (Check the Status of your Virtual Pet)
Notes
Tambotchi currently depends on a guild name provided in a .env file. It can only be run on one server at a time.
